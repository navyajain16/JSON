# JSON
This is a project on manipulation of data using JSON in python. This project is for learning and practice purpose.

For this project we have used fake data available at "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/". 

json.py file consits of the code used to manipulate the data. There are multiple users, each with a unique userId, and each task has a Boolean completed property. We have first determined which users have completed the most tasks. Then we have filtered those who have most tasks completed and saved the output file filtered_data_file.json. 

filtered_data_file.json contains the completed TODOs for each of the users who completed the maximum number of TODOs.
